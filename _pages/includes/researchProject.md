# Research Projects

- <span class="project-tag">Algorithm Lead</span> **Automated Test Generation for Safety-Critical Embedded Software** (2020 - 2023)

  As the algorithm lead for this high-reliability software project, I utilized **State Charts** to model intricate system behaviors. I developed **Search-based Algorithms** to automatically identify test paths and generate test cases, effectively replacing inefficient manual testing processes with high-coverage automation.

- <span class="project-tag">Core Researcher</span> **Reliability Simulation Platform for Distributed Network Systems** (2021 - 2023)

  I developed a comprehensive simulation platform designed to assess the reliability of large-scale, complex networks. By applying **Markov Chains** to model system states, I enabled the calculation of failure risks and achieved real-time reliability prediction under dynamic network conditions.

- <span class="project-tag">Core Researcher</span> **Automated Testing for Deep Learning Object Detection Systems** (2019 - 2022)
 
  I built an automated testing framework tailored for deep learning models like **YOLO**. This project addressed the *Oracle Problem* by leveraging **Metamorphic Testing**, using custom image transformation operators to evaluate model accuracy and robustness without the need for manual data annotation.

- <span class="project-tag">Open Source</span> **[Response Letter LaTeX Template](https://github.com/MaxwelsDonc/responseLetterLatexTemplate)** (2024 - Present)

  To assist the research community, I created and maintain a structured **LaTeX Template** for drafting response letters during the peer-review process. It features a clean design that helps authors organize point-to-point rebuttals to reviewers in a professional and aesthetic manner.
