# About me
I graduated from [SHENYUAN Honors College of Beihang University](http://sae.buaa.edu.cn/index.htm)(北京航空航天大学沈元荣誉学院)and am currently Ph.D. candidate in the [School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University](http://dept3.buaa.edu.cn/index.htm) (北京航空航天大学自动化科学与电气工程学院). My research focuses on software testing and LLM testing, which is becoming increasingly urgent and necessary due to the wide application. If you have any ideas on this topic, please feel free to contact me.
